1. First open terminal and write `npi`.
2. `npm run start`
3. Open new terminal : `npx react-native run android`
4. If you are getting an error something like this :: 
            a. Create a new file `local.properties` within folder /android and paste this line of code
            b. sdk.dir=/Users/shivamgupta/Library/Android/sdk
            c. For you this directory may differ, so better go to 
                - Android studio
                - Go to SDK Manager
                - ANDROID SDK will open from left sidebar.
                - Copy the `Android SDK Location` and paste your directory in here.
